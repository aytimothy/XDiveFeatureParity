		* [ ] + Button gives you energy straight up for free
		* [ ] Instant Level completion
		* [ ] Optionally disabled or set to infinity
	* [ ] Online Multiplayer

		* [ ] Lobbies
	* [ ] Re-add Collaboration Characters, Weapons, Cards, Chips, Events, etc.
		* [ ] Unlockable only via said events or Gatcha
